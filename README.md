# ionic-react-courses-app

Simple course and course related goals management app, with handling user input & application state

### Ionic Components: 
Side Drawer, Tabs, Slide, Modal, Toggle

### React usage: 
- **Courses Context** - with complex previous state management within context handlers
- **useRef** - manually persisting an id by assigning it as a reference within a handler (instead of linking the Ref to an HTML element or component), so that the component will not re-render (vs using state)
[*see: CourseGoals.txs*]

### JS usage: 
immutability, bind
